# ReactDraw

## What is this?
ReactDraw is my attempt on a browser game very similar to skribbl.io.
However I made some tweaks to the gameplay.

## Why?
This is a project I started to learn about React and node.js.
Additionally I use socket.io to sync all clients and learn that stuff aswell.

The code you will see in this project is far from beeing perfect, 
but I learned a lot for the future.
